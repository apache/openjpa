Overview
--------
   The Apache OpenJPA community is proud to release a SNAPSHOT distribution of
   OpenJPA 2.1.0. This distribution is based on the final JSR 317 Java 
   Persistence API, Version 2.0 specification and passes the JPA 2.0 TCK,
   while remaining backwards compatiable with prior releases based on the
   Java Persistence API (JPA 1.0) part of Java Community Process JSR-220
   (Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0). Included in this release are many enhancements,
   fixes, and new functionality; giving developers access to all the new
   features of JPA 2.0, including:

   * Access Types - expanded to allow specification on a per-persistent type
     basis or on individual attributes.
   * Embeddables - expanded to include collections of embeddables, nested
     embeddables, and embeddables containing relationships to other entities.
   * Enhanced Map Collections - expanded to support ElementCollection and new
     annotations for MapKeyColumn, MapKeyClass and MapKeyJoinColumn
   * Derived Identities - enables the ID of an entity to be derived from
     another entity, which provides for parent-to-dependent relationships
   * Query API - methods to get typed query parameters and results, supported
     and in-effect hints and lock mode getter/setter
   * Locking - official support for Pessimistic locking (included in prior
     OpenJPA releases) along with LockModeType properties and hint
   * JPQL Updates -
      ** Embeddables support for path expressions to nested Embeddables and
         Embeddables with relationships
      ** Enhanced Map Collection support for ElementCollection and new query
         expressions for KEY, ENTRY, VALUE
      ** Support for CASE and TYPE expressions along with IN expressions for
         Collection parameters
      ** Support for native date/time/timestamp literals
      ** Support for INDEX expressions on an OrderColumn
   * L2 Cache -
      ** Provides cache operations such as entity eviction and cache mode
         behaviors to use, bypass or refresh items
      ** Per-entity annotation to specify whether an entity should be cached
   * Bean Validation - supports using a JSR 303 implementation for entity
     validation for persist and remove operations
   * Metamodel API -
      ** Provides API to dynamically retrieve metamodel information for a
         persistence unit
      ** Used with Criteria API to generate and execute type safe queries
      ** Supports dynamic or static generation of the metamodel
   * Criteria API -
      ** Provides programmatic construction of queries using an object based
         query graph
      ** Operates on Metamodel objects to provide compile-time type safety
         enforcement
   * EntityManagerFactory API - updated for new L2 Cache, Properties, Criteria
     and Metamodel APIs
   * EntityManager API - updated for new Query and Query Result APIs, Hints,
     Properties, LockModeType, and Detach
   * OSGi - support for the Persistence Unit Service Specification 1.0 in 
     the OSGi Service Platform Release 4 Enterprise Version 4.2 specifications
     has been provided by integration with the Apache Aries JPA module
   * And many more...

   This SNAPSHOT distribution is based upon the contributions provided in
   development iterations after the 2.0.0 release, as defined in the 
   OpenJPA 2.1 Roadmap at:
      http://openjpa.apache.org/jpa-21-roadmap.html

   The OpenJPA 2.1 Roadmap contains a complete list of implemented features and
   feature summaries, including what is on deck for future iterations.

Prerequisites
-------------
   In normal usage, OpenJPA requires Java SE 5 or higher and a relational 
   database of some sort.  The metamodel generation and annotation processing
   features require Java SE 6 or higher.


Documentation
-------------
   If you have questions about OpenJPA, a good source of information is the
   online product manual. You can find the manual for the current release as
   well as older releases of OpenJPA at
       http://openjpa.apache.org/documentation.html

   If you can't find what you're looking for in the manual or would like more
   clarification you please post to the OpenJPA development mailing list.
   Information on all of the OpenJPA mailing lists may be found here:
       http://openjpa.apache.org/mailing-lists.html
