Overview
--------
   The Apache OpenJPA community is proud to release a SNAPSHOT distribution of
   OpenJPA 2.2.0. This distribution is based on the final JSR 317 Java 
   Persistence API, Version 2.0 specification and passes the JPA 2.0 TCK,
   while remaining backwards compatible with prior releases based on the
   Java Persistence API (JPA 1.0) part of Java Community Process JSR-220
   (Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0).
