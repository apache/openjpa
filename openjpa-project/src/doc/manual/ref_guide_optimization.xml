There are numerous techniques you can use in order to ensure that OpenJPA
operates in the fastest and most efficient manner. Following are some
guidelines. Each describes what impact it will have on performance and
scalability. Note that general guidelines regarding performance or scalability
issues are just that - guidelines. Depending on the particular characteristics
of your application, the optimal settings may be considerably different than
what is outlined below.
    </para>
    <para>
In the following table, each row is labeled with a list of italicized keywords.
These keywords identify what characteristics the row in question may improve
upon. Many of the rows are marked with one or both of the <emphasis>performance
</emphasis> and <emphasis>scalability</emphasis> labels. It is important to bear
in mind the differences between performance and scalability (for the most part,
we are referring to system-wide scalability, and not necessarily only
scalability within a single JVM). The performance-related hints will probably
improve the performance of your application for a given user load, whereas the
scalability-related hints will probably increase the total number of users that
your application can service. Sometimes, increasing performance will decrease
scalability, and vice versa. Typically, options that reduce the amount of work
done on the database server will improve scalability, whereas those that push
more work onto the server will have a negative impact on scalability.

The default set of indexes created by OpenJPA's mapping tool may not always be 
the most appropriate for your application. Manually setting indexes in your 
mapping metadata or manually manipulating database indexes to include 
frequently-queried fields (as well as dropping indexes on rarely-queried 
fields) can yield significant performance benefits.
                        <para>
A database must do extra work on insert, update, and delete to maintain an
index. This extra work will benefit selects with WHERE clauses, which will
execute much faster when the terms in the WHERE clause are appropriately
indexed. So, for a read-mostly application, appropriate indexing will slow down
updates (which are rare) but greatly accelerate reads. This means that the
system as a whole will be faster, and also that the database will experience
less load, meaning that the system will be more scalable.
                        </para>
                        <para>
Bear in mind that over-indexing is a bad thing, both for scalability and
performance, especially for applications that perform lots of inserts, updates,
or deletes.

When using OpenJPA's <link linkend="ref_guide_cache">data caching</link> 
features in a transaction that will delete, modify, or create a very large 
number of objects you can set <literal>LargeTransaction</literal> to true and 
perform periodic flushes during your transaction to reduce its memory 
requirements.  See the Javadoc: 
<ulink url="../javadoc/org/apache/openjpa/persistence/OpenJPAEntityManager.html">
OpenJPAEntityManager.setLargeTransaction</ulink>.  Note that transactions in 
large mode have to more aggressively flush items from the data cache.
                        <para>
If your transaction will visit objects that you know are very unlikely to be
accessed by other transactions, for example an exhaustive report run only once a
month, you can turn off population of the data cache so that the transaction
doesn't fill the entire data cache with objects that won't be accessed again.

in-memory dirty instances during queries.  This can sometimes result in OpenJPA
needing to evaluate the entire extent objects in order to return the correct 
query results, which can have drastic performance consequences.  If it is 
appropriate for your application, configuring <literal>FlushBeforeQueries
</literal> to automatically flush before queries involving dirty objects will 
ensure that this never happens. Setting <literal>IgnoreChanges</literal> to

delaying all flushing to a single operation during commit.
                        <para>
Setting <literal>IgnoreChanges</literal> to <literal>true</literal> will help
performance, since dirty objects can be ignored for queries, meaning that
incremental flushing or client-side processing is not necessary. It will also
improve scalability, since overall database server usage is diminished. On the
other hand, setting <literal>IgnoreChanges</literal> to <literal>false</literal>
will have a negative impact on scalability, even when using automatic flushing
before queries, since more operations will be performed on the database server.

Mapping inheritance hierarchies to a single database table is faster for most

For applications that perform large bulk inserts, the retrieval of sequence

Using datastore transactions translates into pessimistic database row locking, 
which can be a performance hit (depending on the database). If appropriate for 
your application, optimistic transactions are typically faster than datastore 
transactions.
                        <para>
Optimistic transactions provide the same transactional guarantees as datastore
transactions, except that you must handle a potential optimistic verification
exception at the end of a transaction instead of assuming that a transaction
will successfully complete. In many applications, it is unlikely that different
concurrent transactions will operate on the same set of data at the same time,
so optimistic verification increases the concurrency, and therefore both the
performance and scalability characteristics, of the application. A common
approach to handling optimistic verification exceptions is to simply present the
end user with the fact that concurrent modifications happened, and require that
the user redo any work.

Using aggregates to compute reporting data on the database server can 
drastically speed up queries.  Similarly, using projections when you are 
interested in specific object fields or relations rather than the entire object
state can reduce the amount of data OpenJPA must transfer from the database to 
your application.

Attaching and even persisting instances can be more efficient when your detached
objects use detached state managers. By default, OpenJPA does not use detached
state managers when serializing an instance across tiers. See
<xref linkend="ref_guide_detach_graph"/> for how to force OpenJPA to use
detached state managers across tiers, and for other options for more efficient
attachment.

If you have enabled scrollable result sets and on-demand loading but do you not
require it, consider disabling it again.  Some JDBC drivers and databases

If you are using a <link linkend="openjpa.jdbc.SchemaFactory"><literal>

Recall that XA transactions are distinct from managed transactions - managed
transaction services such as that provided by EJB declarative transactions can
be used both with XA and non-XA transactions. XA transactions should only be
used when a given business transaction involves multiple different transactional

example).

There is a small amount of extra overhead for OpenJPA to maintain collections 
where each element is not guaranteed to be unique.  If your application does 
not require duplicates for a collection, you should always declare your
fields to be of type <classname>Set, SortedSet, HashSet,</classname> or 
<classname>TreeSet</classname>.

The <link linkend="ref_guide_fetch">fetch groups</link> used when loading an 
object control how much data is eagerly loaded, and by extension, which fields 
must be lazily loaded at a future time. The ideal fetch group configuration 
loads all the data that is needed in one fetch, and no extra fields - this 
minimizes both the amount of data transferred from the database, and the
number of trips to the database.
                        <para>
If extra fields are specified in the fetch groups (in particular, large fields
such as binary data, or relations to other persistence-capable objects), then
network overhead (for the extra data) and database processing (for any necessary
additional joins) will hurt your application's performance. If too few fields
are specified in the fetch groups, then OpenJPA will have to make additional
trips to the database to load additional fields as necessary.
