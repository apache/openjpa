     * Causes the current thread to wait until it is signalled or interrupted,
     * or the specified waiting time elapses. This method originally appears
     * in the {@link Condition} interface, but it was moved to here since it
     * can only be emulated, with very little accuracy guarantees: the
     * efficient implementation requires accurate nanosecond timer and native
     * support for nanosecond-precision wait queues, which are not usually
     * present in JVMs prior to 1.5. Loss of precision may cause total waiting
     * times to be systematically shorter than specified when re-waits occur.
     * The lock associated with this condition is atomically
     * released and the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling
     * purposes and lies dormant until <em>one</em> of five things happens:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Some other thread invokes the {@link
     * edu.emory.mathcs.backport.java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition#signal}
     * method for this
     * <tt>Condition</tt> and the current thread happens to be chosen as the
     * thread to be awakened; or
     * <li>Some other thread invokes the {@link
     * edu.emory.mathcs.backport.java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition#signalAll}
     * method for this
     * <tt>Condition</tt>; or
     * <li>Some other thread {@link Thread#interrupt interrupts} the current
     * thread, and interruption of thread suspension is supported; or
     * <li>The specified waiting time elapses; or
     * <li>A &quot;<em>spurious wakeup</em>&quot; occurs.
     * </ul> In all cases, before this method can return the current thread must
     * re-acquire the lock associated with this condition. When the
     * thread returns it is <em>guaranteed</em> to hold this lock.
     * If the current thread:
     * <ul>
     * <li>has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or
     * <li>is {@link Thread#interrupt interrupted} while waiting
     * and interruption of thread suspension is supported,
     * </ul>
     * then {@link InterruptedException} is thrown and the current thread's
     * interrupted status is cleared. It is not specified, in the first
     * case, whether or not the test for interruption occurs before the lock
     * is released. The method returns an estimate of the number of nanoseconds
     * remaining to wait given the supplied <tt>nanosTimeout</tt>
     * value upon return, or a value less than or equal to zero if it
     * timed out. Accuracy of this estimate is directly dependent on the
     * accuracy of {@link #nanoTime}. This value can be used to determine
     * whether and how long to re-wait in cases where the wait returns but an
     * awaited condition still does not hold. Typical uses of this method take
     * the following form:
     * 
     * <pre> synchronized boolean aMethod(long timeout, TimeUnit unit) {
     * long nanosTimeout = unit.toNanos(timeout);
     * while (!conditionBeingWaitedFor) { if (nanosTimeout &gt; 0)
     * nanosTimeout = theCondition.awaitNanos(nanosTimeout); else return false;
     * } // ... }
     * </pre>
     * 
     * <b>Implementation Considerations</b>
     * The current thread is assumed to hold the lock associated with this
     * <tt>Condition</tt> when this method is called.
     * It is up to the implementation to determine if this is
     * the case and if not, how to respond. Typically, an exception will be
     * thrown(such as {@link IllegalMonitorStateException}) and the
     * implementation must document that fact.
     * A condition implementation can favor responding to an interrupt over
     * normal method return in response to a signal, or over indicating the
     * elapse of the specified waiting time. In either case the implementation
     * must ensure that the signal is redirected to another waiting thread, if
     * there is one.
     *
     * @param cond the condition to wait for
     * @param nanosTimeout the maximum time to wait, in nanoseconds
     * @return A value less than or equal to zero if the wait has
     * timed out; otherwise an estimate, that
     * is strictly less than the <tt>nanosTimeout</tt> argument,
     * of the time still remaining when this method returned.
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted(and
     * interruption of thread suspension is supported).
