    context will remain active until the current transaction commits.

	EntityManager with.

	transactions.

	can only perform this operation during an active transaction.

	annotations.
unsupported: OpenJPA does not yet support "{1}" as used in "{0}".
bad-meta-anno: The type of field "{0}" isn''t supported by declared \
	persistence strategy "{1}".  Please choose a different strategy.
no-pers-strat: Fields "{0}" are not a default persistent type, and do not \
	have any annotations indicating their persistence strategy.  If you do \
	not want these fields to be persisted, annotate them with @Transient.

	generation type.  The only valid generator names under AUTO are "uuid-hex" \
	and "uuid-string".

	must have names.
bad-fg-field: Fetch group "{0}" in type "{1}" includes field "{2}", but \
	this field is not declared in "{1}", or is not persistent.  Currently, \
	OpenJPA only supports declared fields in fetch groups.

	"{1}" can''t be parsed.

    intended for this to be persistent, please add a corresponding setter, \
    or switch to field access for this type hierarchy.
transformer-registration-error: An error occurred while registering a \
    ClassTransformer with {0}. The error has been consumed. To see it, set \
    your openjpa.Runtime log level to TRACE. Load-time class transformation \
