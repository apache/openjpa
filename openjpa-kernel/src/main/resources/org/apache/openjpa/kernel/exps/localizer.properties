	in-memory.  If you do not intend for this query to execute in-memory, \
	consider setting IgnoreCache to true for the query.
not-comp: The evaluation of the ordering expression of this query produced \
	non-comparable values "{0}" and "{1}".  Please check that the ordering \
	clause is valid.
agg-in-filter: If you use an aggregate function in a query filter, you must \
	make sure to only invoke the aggregate on collections.
parse-error: An error occurred while parsing the query filter "{1}". \
	Error message: {0}
non-numeric-path: field {0} of type {1}
non-numeric-value: value of type {0}
non-numeric-comparison: Filter invalid. Cannot compare {0} to {1}. Numeric \
	comparisons must be between numeric types only. To enable such comparisons \
	for backwards-compatibility, add "QuotedNumbersInQueries=true" to the \
	org.apache.openjpa.Compatibility setting in your configuration.
