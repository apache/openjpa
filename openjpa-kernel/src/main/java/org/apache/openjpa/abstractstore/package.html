<p><strong>OpenJPA Abstract StoreManager Implementation</strong></p>

<p>
    This package provides some infrastructure classes to help in the creation
    of OpenJPA drivers for new non-relational data stores.
</p>

<p>
    To create support for a new data store:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Extend <code>AbstractStoreManager</code> following the rules
                outlined in its documentation.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Configure your org.apache.openjpa.properties file (or your
                resource archive
                configuration file) to use <code>
                AbstractStoreBrokerFactory</code>,
                and specify your <code>AbstractStore</code> extension as the
                <code>
                    org.apache.openjpa.abstractstore.AbstractStoreManager</code>
                class:
            </p>

            <p>
                <code>
                    org.apache.openjpa.BrokerFactory: abstractstore<br/>
                    org.apache.openjpa.abstractstore.AbstractStoreManager:
                    com.xyz.MyAbstractStoreManagerSubclass
                </code>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, you can optionally extend <code>
    OpenJPAConfigurationImpl</code>
    to define your own configuration options, using the helper classes defined
    in the <a href="../../openjpa/conf/package.html">
    <code>org.apache.openjpa.lib.conf</code></a> package. To do this you must
    also
    override the <code>AbstractStoreManager.newConfiguration</code> method.
</p>

<p>
    For a sample of how to use this package, see the
    <a href="../xml/package.html"><code>org.apache.openjpa.xmlstore</code></a>
    abstract
    store implementation.
