/**
 * An entity that wishes to be notified when Brokers
 * associated with remote BrokerFactories commit.
 * A RemoteCommitListener <b>is not</b> notified of commits that originated
 * with a Broker created from the BrokerFactory that it is
 * registered with. (Of course, if a listener is registered with multiple
 * factories, this situation might be complicated a bit.)
 * Usage:
 * <code><pre> import org.apache.openjpa.event.*;
 * import org.apache.openjpa.conf.*;
 * <p/>
 * {@link org.apache.openjpa.conf.OpenJPAConfiguration} conf = factory.getConfiguraiton();
 *  RemoteCommitListener l = new RemoteCommitListener() {
 * public void afterCommit({@link RemoteCommitEvent} e) {
 * // update a Swing widget when remote brokers make
 * // changes to reference data }
 *  public void close() { } };
 *  conf.getRemoteCommitEventManager().addListener(l);
 * </pre></code>
