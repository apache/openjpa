 * Interface implemented by OpenJPA state managers. Each state manager
 * manages the state of a single persistence capable instance. The
 * state manager is also responsible for all communications about the
 * instance to the {@link StoreManager}.
 *  The <code>fetchXXXField</code> and <code>storeXXXField</code>
 * methods can be used to get and set fields of the managed persistent object.
 * Most back-end code, however, should use the similar
 * <code>fetchXXX</code> and <code>storeXXX</code> methods in place of
 * the field methods. These methods function just like the field methods, but
 * also pass the value through the externalizer and factory the field may have.
