/**
 * Represents a value that can be joined to. Any column that a user
 * joins to must be "owned" by an entity that implements this interface.
 * The system maps columns to joinables to be able to decompose oids and
 * field values into individual join values on a per-column basis. This
 * allows us to support joins to only some of the columns of a mapping, and
 * to be loose with the ordering of foreign key columns relative to the
 * ordering of the joined-to columns. Having a separate interface for
 * joinables also allows us to perform tricks such as a vertically-mapped
 * application identity subclass transparently transforming columns of its
 * foreign key to the corresponding primary key fields in the base class.
