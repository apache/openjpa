<p><strong>OpenJPA-JDBC Schema Management</strong></p>

<p>
    This package provides utilities for managing the schema of
    persistent objects stored in a relational database.
</p>

<p>
    Schema components themselves are little more than standard Java beans.
    Helper classes are responsible for added functionality such as XML
    serialization/deserialization, etc.
