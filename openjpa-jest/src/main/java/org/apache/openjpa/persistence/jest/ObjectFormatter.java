/**
 * A parameterized interface defines the protocol for converting {@link OpenJPAStateManager managed} persistence
 * instances or a persistent {@link Metamodel domain model} into a form suitable for transport to a language-neutral
 * client such as an web browser.
 * <p>
 * The interface prefers that the resultant resource as a <em>complete</em> representation i.e. all the references
 * contained in the resource can be resolved within the same resource itself. As the intended recipient of this
 * resource is a remote client, an <em>incomplete</em> resource will require the client to request further for
 * any (unresolved) reference resulting in a <em>chatty</em> protocol.
 * <p>
 * This interface also defines methods for writing the representation into an output stream e.g.
 * {@link HttpServletResponse#getOutputStream() response output stream} of a HTTP Servlet.
 * <p>
 * Implementation Note:  Each concrete formatter type is registered with {@linkplain PrototypeFactory factory}
 * that requires the implementation to have a no-argument constructor.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of encoded output
