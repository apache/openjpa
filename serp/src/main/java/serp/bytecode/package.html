	<p><strong>Bytecode Manipuation</strong></p>
	<p>
		This package contains a framework for Java bytecode manipulation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Bytecode manipulation is a powerful tool in the arsenal of the Java
		developer.  It can be used for tasks from compiling alternative 
		programming languages to run in a JVM, to creating new classes on the
		fly at runtime, to instrumenting classes for performance analysis, to
		debugging, to altering or enhancing the capabilities of existing
		compiled classes.  Traditionally, however, this power has come at a
		price: modifying bytecode has required an in-depth knowledge of the
		class file structure and has necessitated very low-level programming
		techniques.  These costs have proven too much for most developers, and 
	 	bytecode manipulation has been largely ignored by the mainstream.
	</p>
	<p>
		The goal of the serp bytecode framework is to tap the full power of
		bytecode modification while lowering its associated costs.
		The framework provides a set of high-level APIs for manipulating all 
		aspects of bytecode, from large-scale structures like class member 
		fields to the individual instructions that comprise the code of 
		methods.  While in order to perform any advanced manipulation, some 
		understanding of the 
		<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/2nd-edition/html/ClassFile.doc.html">
		class file format</a> and especially of the 
		<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/2nd-edition/html/Instructions.doc.html">
		JVM instruction set</a> is necessary, the framework makes it as easy
		as possible to enter the world of bytecode development.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are several other excellent bytecode frameworks available.   Serp
		excels, however, in the following areas:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<em>Ease of use.</em>  Serp provides very high-level APIs for 
				all normal bytecode modification functionality.   Additionally,
				the framework contains a large set of convenience methods to 
				make code that uses it as clean as possible.  From overloading
				its methods to prevent you from having to make type 
				conversions, to making shortcuts for operations like adding 
				default constructors, serp tries to take the pain out of 
				bytecode development.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Power.</em>  Serp does not hide any of the power of
				bytecode manipulation behind a limited set of high-level 
				functions.  In addition to its available high-level APIs, which
				themselves cover the functionality all but the most advanced
				users will ever need, serp gives you direct access to the 
				low-level details of the class file and constant pool.  You 
				can even switch back and
				forth between low-level and high-level operations;
				serp maintains complete consistency of the class structure
				at all times.  A change to a method descriptor in the constant
				pool, for example, will immediately change the return values
				of all the high-level APIs that describe that method.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Constant pool management.</em>  In the class file format,
				all constant values are stored in a constant pool of shared
				entries to minimize the size of class structures.  Serp gives
				you access to the constant pool directly, but most of you
				will never use it; serp's high-level APIs completely
				abstract management of the constant pool.
				Any time a new constant is needed, serp will automatically add
				it to the pool while ensuring that no duplicates ever exist.
				Serp also does its best to manipulate the pool so that the
				effects of changing a constant are as expected: i.e. changing
				one instruction to use the string "bar" instead of "foo" 
				will not affect other instructions that use the string "foo",
				but changing the name of a class field will instantly change
				all instructions that reference that field to use the new name.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Instruction morphing.</em>  Dealing with the individual
				instructions that make up method code is the most difficult
				part of bytecode manipulation.  To facilitate this process,
				most serp instruction representations have the ability to
				change their underlying low-level opcodes on the fly as the
				you modify the parameters of the instruction.  For 
				example, accessing the constant integer value 0 requires the
				opcode <code>iconst0</code>, while accessing the string 
				constant "foo" requires a different opcode, <code>ldc</code>,
				followed by the constant pool index of "foo".  In serp, however,
				there is only one instruction, <code>constant</code>.  This
				instruction has <code>setValue</code> methods which use the
				given value to automatically determine the correct opcodes and
				arguments -- <code>iconst0</code> for a value of 0 and 
				<code>ldc</code> plus the proper constant pool index for the
				value of "foo".
			</li>
		</ul> 
	</p>
	<p>
		Serp is not ideally suited to all applications.  Here are a few
		disadvantages of serp:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<em>Speed.</em>  Serp is not built for speed.  Though there
				are plans for performing incremental parsing, serp currently
				fully parses class files when a class is loaded, which is a 
				slow process.
				Also, serp's insistence on full-time consistency between the
				low and high level class structures slows down both access and
				mutator methods.  These factors are less of a concern, though,
				when creating new classes at runtime (rather than modifying 
				existing code), or when using serp as part of the compilation
				process.  Serp excels in both of these scenarios.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Memory.</em>  Serp's high-level structures for representing
				class bytecode are very memory-hungry.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Multi-threaded modifications.</em>  The serp toolkit is
				not threadsafe.  Multiple threads cannot safely make
				modifications to the same classes the same time.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Project-level modifications.</em>  Changes made in one
				class in a serp project are not yet automatically propogated
				to other classes.  However, there are plans to implement this,
				as well as plans to allow operations to modify bytecode based
				on specified patterns, similar to aspect-oriented programming.
			</li>
		</ul>

		The first class that you should study in this package is the 
		{@link serp.bytecode.Project} type.  From there, move onto the 
		{@link serp.bytecode.BCClass}, and trace its APIs into 
		{@link serp.bytecode.BCField}s, {@link serp.bytecode.BCMethod}s,
		and finally into actual {@link serp.bytecode.Code}.
