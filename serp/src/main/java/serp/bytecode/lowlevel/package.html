	<p><strong>Lowlevel Bytecode Manipuation</strong></p>
	<p>
		This package contains facilities for lowlevel bytecode manipulation
		through the class constant pool.  It is generally not necessary to use
 		this package directly, as all necessary functionality is made available
		at a high level via the <code>serp.bytecode</code> package.
