/**
 * A persistent entity that owns bidirectional single-valued relationship.
 * A bidirectional relationship has only an owning side, which is this receiver.
 * Given the following relationship between Entity A and Entity B:
 *   Entity A refers to a single instance of Entity B
 *   Entity B refers to a single instance of Entity A
 * If Entity B qualifies its relation to the Entity A with mappedBy
 * annotation qualifier then Entity B is called owned and Entity A is called
 * owner with respect to the above relationship.
