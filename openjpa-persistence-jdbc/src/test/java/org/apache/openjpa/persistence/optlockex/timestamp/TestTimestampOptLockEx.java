            // DB2 (see DB2Dictionary.datePrecision) when sending the value to the db.

            // 2014-01-22 07:22:11.549 (for Oracle).  Notice in either case we rounded up.

            // has been rounded up, as I'll explain:
            // As part of this merge/commit, we select the timestamp from the db to get its value
            // (see method ColumnVersionStrategy.checkVersion below), i.e:
            // 'SELECT t0.updateTimestamp FROM VersionTSEntity t0 WHERE t0.id = ?'.
            // We then compare the 'in-memory' timestamp to that which we got back from the DB, i.e. on
            // DB2 we compare:
            // in-mem:  2014-01-22 07:22:11.548778567
            // from db: 2014-01-22 07:22:11.548779
            // Because these do not 'compare' properly (the db version is greater), we throw the OptimisticLockEx!!
            // For completeness, lets look at an example where the timestamp is as follows after the above
            // update: 2014-01-22 07:22:11.548771234.  We would send to DB2
            // the following value: 2014-01-22 07:22:11.548771.  Then, as part of the very last merge/commit, we'd
            // compare:
            // in-mem:  2014-01-22 07:22:11.548771234
            // from db: 2014-01-22 07:22:11.548771
            // These two would 'compare' properly (the db version is lesser), as such we would not throw an
            // OptLockEx and the test works fine.
